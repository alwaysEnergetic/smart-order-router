/**
 * Contains functions for generating gas estimates for given routes.
 *
 * We generally compute gas estimates off-chain because
 *  1/ Calling eth_estimateGas for a swaps requires the caller to have
 *     the full balance token being swapped, and approvals.
 *  2/ Tracking gas used using a wrapper contract is not accurate with Multicall
 *     due to EIP-2929
 *  3/ For V2 we simulate all our swaps off-chain so have no way to track gas used.
 *
 * Generally these models should be optimized to return quickly by performing any
 * long running operations (like fetching external data) outside of the functions defined.
 * This is because the functions in the model are called once for every route and every
 * amount that is considered in the algorithm so it is important to minimize the number of
 * long running operations.
